    "--> Class-based exceptions match by superclass relationships by naming a superclass in an exception handler will catch instances of that class, as well as instances of any of its subclasses lower in the class tree. Because of this, we can think of superclasses as general exception categories and subclasses as more specific types of exceptions within those categories."

    "\n",
    "-->  We can attach context information to class-based exceptions by filling out instance attributes in the instance object raised, usually in a custom class constructor.\n",
    "--> For simpler needs, built-in exception superclasses provide a constructor that stores its arguments on the instance automatically (as a tuple in the attribute args).\n",

In practice, this made string-based exceptions easier to use at first when programs were small, but more complex to use as programs grew larger."
