    "1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> A class is called an Abstract class if it contains one or more abstract methods.\n",
    "--> An abstract superclass is a class that calls a method, but does not inherit or define it. It expects the method to be filled in by a subclass. This is often used as a way to generalize classes when behavior cannot be predicted until a more specific subclass is coded. Object oriented programming frameworks also uses this as a way to dispatch to client-defined, customizable operations"

    "2. What happens when a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> In python, the statements which are not indented are called a top-level statement. Internally python gives a special name to top-level statements as __main__.\n",
    "--> When a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement it will create a class variable(we can say it attaches a data attribute to the class).\n",
    "--> An assignment statement of the form <varname> = <expr> at the top-level in a class definition creates a class variable(we can say it attaches a data attribute to the class).\n",
