    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> OOP stands for Object Oriented programming. In python OOP is a programming concept/approach that uses objects and classes in programming. The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code and it aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation in the programming."

    "Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> In Python, inheritance happens when an object is qualified, and involves searching an attribute definition tree (one or more namespaces). Every time you use an expression of the form object.attr where object is an instance or class object, Python searches the namespace tree at and above object, for the first attr it can find. Because lower definitions in the tree override higher ones, inheritance forms the basis of specialization.\n",
    "--> Attribute fetches are simply tree searches. In inheritance objects lower in a tree inherit attributes attached to objects higher in that tree. As the search proceeds from the bottom up, in a sense, the objects linked into a tree are the union of all the attributes defined in all their tree parents, all the way up the tree."

    "Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Class is a blueprint for the object. An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined only the description for the object is defined and there is no memory allocation done.\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Class Object: When we create a class in python then a class object is created so whenever python finds a class statement in the whole program then it creates a class object and assigns a name to that object i.e. class name. As we know in python, everything is an object so the class itself is an object and is the instance of metaclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Instance Object: When we call a class, it creates an instance object of that class from which the object has been created. Instance objects are real objects in your python code process. The instance object has access to attributes of the class from which it is created. Instance object inherits the attributes of the class object from which it was created."

The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object’s attributes and serves no other purpose. It is only used within classes."
