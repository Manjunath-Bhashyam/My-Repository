    "\n",
    "--> A metaclass is a class whose instances are classes. Just as an ordinary class defines the behavior of certain objects, a metaclass defines the behavior of certain classes and their instances.\n",
    "--> Metaclasses may have methods and data to provide behavior for their classes too and constitute a secondary pathway for inheritance search but their attributes are accessible only to their class instances, not to their instance’s instances."

    "\n",
    "--> Class decorators and metaclasses both are automatically triggered at the end of a class statement.\n",
    "--> They both can be used to handle classes. Decorators rebind a class name to a callable’s result and metaclasses route class creation through a callable, but both hooks can be used for similar purposes.\n",
    "--> To manage classes, decorators simply augment and return the original class objects. Metaclasses augment a class after they create it. Decorators may have a slight disadvantage in this role if a new class must be defined, because the original class has already been created."
