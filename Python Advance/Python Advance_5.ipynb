    "\n",
    "--> Multiple inheritance means Inherting more than one parent/super classes.\n",
    "--> It is useful for mixing together multiple packages of class-based code. The left-to-right order in class statement headers determines the general order of attribute searches."

    "\n",
    "--> Composition is also known as \"Has-A Relation\". It is a fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming that describes a class that references to one or more objects of other classes as an Instance variable. Here, by using the class name or by creating the object we can access the members of one class inside another class. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of different classes. It means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component."

    "\n",
    "--> Pseudoprivate attributes are those whose names begin but do not end with two leading underscores i.e. __X.\n",
    "--> They are used to localize names to the enclosing class. This includes both class attributes like methods defined inside the class and self instance attributes assigned inside the classâ€™s methods. Such names are expanded to include the class name which makes them generally unique."
