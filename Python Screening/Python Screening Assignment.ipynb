    "--> Abstract class: It is a blueprint for other classes and is a class which contains one or more abstract methods. It allows us to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. By defining an abstract base class, we can define a common Application Program Interface(API) for a set of subclasses. Python comes with a module that provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC) and that module name is ABC. ABC works by decorating methods of the base class as abstract and then registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract base. A method becomes abstract when decorated with the keyword @abstractmethod."
